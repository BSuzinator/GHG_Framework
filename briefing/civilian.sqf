		Last week one of the officers from SOCOM was taken hostage from a routine convoy in Takistan. Earlier this morning we got intel that he was being held here in Zargabad, and a local insurgent cell wants to negotiate for his release. These insurgents have been a thorn in the local authorities collective side, and they have also contacted us to aid in ousting them. The Russians have an Airbase in the region, however they have made a point of staying quiet throughout all this. We suspect they are supplying the insurgents, but no evidence can be found, so no action can be taken.

			We need to rescue the Officer by any means necessary. There have been rumors of where the insurgent HQ is, however we are not here to kick a hornets' nest unless we have to. We lost the last drone we flew over the area from interference, so be on the lookout for a Jammer.
